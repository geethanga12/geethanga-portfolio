## 🎯 To Continue Implementation

### Option 1: I Continue Now
I can continue building the remaining components. This will take several more messages as there are many components to create:
- ~10-15 more component files
- ~5 hook files
- ~3 3D component files
- API route
- Main page integration

**Time**: This conversation will continue for another 30-40 messages to complete everything.

### Option 2: You Run the Setup & I Build Components Later
You can:
1. Run `cd nextjs-portfolio && npm install` to install dependencies
2. Copy your assets (photos, CV) to the public folder
3. Let me know when ready, and I'll create all remaining components in batches

### Option 3: I Create a Starter Package
I can create the most essential components now so you have a working basic version, then we can enhance it with 3D features later.

---

## 💻 What You Can Do Right Now

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project
```bash
cd "c:\Coding\VS code - All projects\My Portfolio\claude-portfolio-01\nextjs-portfolio"
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- React & Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Three.js & React Three Fiber
- Framer Motion
- React Hook Form
- React Hot Toast
- And all other dependencies

### Step 3: Prepare Assets
Create these folders and add your files:
```
public/
  assets/
    Geeth_img.JPG (your photo)
    Geethanga_Dissanayake_CV.pdf (your CV)
  favicon.ico
  og-image.jpg (for social media previews)
```
